# AIT-ML-CarPricePredictionV2-st125982
Car Price Prediction Model built on Linear Regression Version 2.
In version 2. I built a linear regression model and saved it to the model folder in the app folder. I used joblib to save and load the model, replacing pickle.
Additionally, I have developed an application using Dash Plotly, which allows users to utilize both versions within the version 2 application.
